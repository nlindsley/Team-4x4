2/15/16:  Charles Heckel  solved the github issue,  I'm very sorry if it doesn't work without having to install libgdx.  
                          If a libgdx install is required I can post a walkthrough about that, or you can go through mitch's first slideshow.

2/1/16:   Charles Heckel  Good news everyone, I found my code and setup libgdx.  I'll sort through, organize, and upload the code at some point today, or tomorrow (2/3/16)
